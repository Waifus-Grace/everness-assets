Sigh... that's why film cameras are leagues better.\r\nDay ██\r\n Discussed with the store owner and borrowed the OLYCA M100II he just bought a while ago to shoot for a day. As expected, a film camera is just so much better. Too bad the darkroom in the shop hasn't been in use for a long time. Who would have thought when we first opened the shop that, after so many years, it would be so difficult to find a place to develop film?\r\n█/█\r\nWeird... I was going to take some photos yesterday, but the film in my bag was gone. I thought I left it at the photo studio, but I checked today and it wasn't there either. How curious... Bohr said that the portable hard drive with the stored negatives was gone too. Do we have a thief on our hands? But why would a thief steal the film in my bag instead of the cameras or cold hard cash? I can't figure it out. Forget it, better focus on the work at hand... my schedule's full until the end of next month.\r\n███\r\n These past few days have been exhausting... had shootings lined up from morning till night. If I find out who lost the portable hard drive, I'll give them a good talking-to for sure! Some others have already started using the new-generation cameras. They say that the operation methods haven't changed much compared to the previous generation ones, so I'm relieved. Sigh... I'm an old man now, yet I still have to keep up to date with those new cameras every now and then. Maybe I should persuade the boss to clean up the darkroom.

Not sweet, not powdery, not greasy. \r\nMaybe I can try using Calone and white floral fragrance. \r\n\r\nDanzaburou: \r\nThe napkin carries the scent of grilled tofu from the Fujiwara Tofu, tempura rice from Budori, seasoning sauce from the Rolling Stone BBQ, and the smell of rotting apples...

If you savor it carefully, you can even detect a faint coin smell.\r\n\r\nPainty: \r\nIt's the paint smell brought out by methyl violet ketone. Oh, no, my nose is about to explode...\r\n\r\nInspiration Terminator: \r\nI don't really want to smell it...\r\n\r\nEternal Lamp:\r\nA faint strange smell... Reminds me of the smell of battery leakage. \r\n\r\nEmpty Shell: \r\nThe beginning is a very clean, metallic cold aldehyde scent, but when you get closer, you can smell a fresh lily, probably left by the previous visitor who took a photo with him.\r\n\r\nBittercake:\r\nInitially, it has a strong, deeply roasted bitter coffee scent, which slowly transforms into a repressed, gloomy burnt smell. Maybe I can try adding vetiver, sandalwood, bright fat (amber), and tonka bean to slowly neutralize this olfactory bitterness. \r\n\r\nFluffy: \r\nThe smell of sun-dried cotton fabric, dried mites, air, and water combined to form the scent of sunlight, very warm.",

Most people have one side of their profile that looks better. Before shooting, ask the customer which side they prefer. If it's a regular customer, figure it out before the shoot.\r\n3. When taking overhead shots, it's best to have the person sit down instead of stand, as it can make them look short.\r\n4. If the customer is not good at posing, let them move around freely and try to capture candid shots. However, note that the parameters for candid shots need to be adjusted more compared to those of fixed poses.",

    "cang01_Player_044": "When was the last time he came?",
    "cang01_NPC02701_006": "He doesn't seem like a kid who would just run from home and make his parents worry about him...",
    "cang01_NPC03801_008": "But he never brought up anything to us...",
    "cang01_Player_130": "They told me that they saw this coming because they'd spoken with a doctor and had been told that kids could end up being aphasic if they stopped talking for too long. I mean, the cause ended up becoming an anomaly...",
    "cang01_NPC03801_005": "Man... I hope he didn't run into an anomaly!",
    "cang01_NPC03401_003": "He was in charge of growing the flowers in the club, and he actually put his mind to it. He'd give the flowers as gifts to people who are nice to him.",
    "cang01_Player_077": "He went missing after school yesterday, and apparently, he'd just heard about how there was this flower in this manor that no one had seen before right before he went missing.",
    "cang01_Player_139": "He didn't have a message for us, but... I knew that this was meant for both you and me when I saw it.",
    "cang01_Player_060": "So he's a transfer student?",
    "cang01_NPC03901_004": "He is... a good kid! He's never been anywhere dangerous, and he'd never go anywhere on his own without telling anyone...",
    "cang01_Player_021": "Does he enjoy gardening?",
    "cang01_Player_065": "Did he ever struggle at school?",
    "cang01_NPC03801_028": "If there is anything you think will be helpful with the investigation, we'll do our best to cooperate.",
    "cang01_NPC006_038": "Pre-task prep is his job, he's thorough like that, so you know, should leave it to the professionals",
    "cang01_NPC006_059": "You didn't tell them anything that would set off another panic attack, rookie. I see you're super gentle there.",
    "cang01_Player_110": "I'm almost sure that something is making him say these things... This anomaly has run deep in him...",
    "cang01_NPC006_017": "Plus, your task seems more important than tea.",
    "cang01_NPC006_056": "Not to mention that our dear director can't wait to give {Gender}|gender(he,she) some more work...",
    "cang01_NPC005_042": "Good work.",
    "cang01_Player_107": "Do you smell the language in the smell coming from the flowers, too?",
    "cang01_Player_039": "Won't it be inconvenient for the ETD to be involved?",
    "cang01_NPC005_024": "What did you guys do?",
    "cang01_NPC005_044": "What did you guys do?",
    "cang01_Player_007": "Maiyue lost contact with you and never went back home the whole night. As far as I am concerned, no evidence was found to point the case towards the doing of an anomaly, right?",
    "cang01_NPC006_020": "Your store's management approach is becoming—",
    "cang01_Player_016": "Are you close to Maiyue?",
    "cang01_Player_005": "Hi, are you the client of the missing person commission? I'm an Anomaly Hunter from Eibon.",
    "cang01_NPC006_054": "Did you forget what {Gender}|gender(he,she) is capable of? {Gender}|gender(He,She) is not a friendly citizen who needs help.",
    "cang01_NPC04901_001": "The boy in the picture?",
    "cang01_Player_031": "You're talking about... yourself? Won't it trouble you?",
    "cang01_Player_116": "You'd bring a gift home every week... and you came here hoping to find a flower that would show your parents what you wanted them to know.",
    "cang01_Player_119": "Your parents are waiting for you to go home with this...",
    "cang01_NPC006_051": "I love how you're catching on so fast.",
    "Tcang01_NPC006_012": "Which club do you think suits me best?",
    "cang01_NPC005_004": "If I didn't have to waste time searching for the missing captain... it would be easier.",
    "cang01_Player_127": "I don't think I'd have been able to finish the commission at the manor the other day without you and Mr. Skia, so it only makes sense that I share the reward with you...",
    "cang01_NPC03301_002": "We don't really know where he went, and we've told our teachers that. If there is anything we can help with, though, feel free to let us know.",
    "cang01_NPC010_007": "I'm afraid you'll be flying solo for the time being, though, seeing as we all have our own business to deal with now.",
    "cang01_NPC006_033": "I'm allergic to the smell of books. I'll look for clues elsewhere! See ya!",
    "cang01_NPC006_063": "Want to try saying something else as a test?",
    "cang01_NPC006_123": "Want to try saying something else as a test?",
    "cang01_NPC006_036": "Plus, I think you need me more now.",
    "cang01_NPC005_011": "An abnormal fluctuation in the Wertheimer Index was reported here in this deserted manor in the wee hours.",
    "cang01_NPC006_034": "Phew, that was close... You wouldn't snitch, right?",
    "Tcang01_NPC006_019": "He only seemed like he didn't want to talk at first because had a hard time expressing himself, but that took a toll on his vocal capabilities as it went on. It was a vicious cycle.",
    "cang01_NPC005_032": "Never mind him. He's doing just fine.",
    "cang01_Player_006": "That's fine. We can take our time.",
    "cang01_NPC006_128": "Yesterday... What else did you guys talk about? Teenagers never run out of things to talk about.",
    "cang01_NPC006_044": "I see. Well, guess that will do.",
    "cang01_Player_003": "Right.",
    "cang01_NPC006_004": "Fighting side by side means so little to you, huh?",
    "cang01_Player_017": "I see...",
    "cang01_Player_147": "Should we talk to their teacher, then? I mean it might be a little awkward since we came sneaking in... uhm...",
    "cang01_NPC03801_019": "Hey! About my son... the Security Office has filed it as a missing person case.",
    "cang01_NPC03801_001": "Anomaly Hunter from the antique shop! Did you look into the situation...? Oh... my son...",
    "cang01_NPC03301_005": "It might sound a bit too self-conscious... he probably did that because he thought he always made people go out of their way to look after him.",
    "cang01_NPC006_068": "Are they language organs at the same time?",
    "cang01_Player_018": "Sounds like a good kid...",
    "cang01_NPC04801_006": "The boy's parents told me that the boy slowly stopped talking ever since he started going to school... probably because he was trying to avoid all the attention.",
    "cang01_NPC03403_005": "From my grandpa. He didn't know much either, but the story is apparently based on this deserted manor in the suburbs of the Bridge District.",
    "cang01_NPC006_041": "Woah, that sure makes me feel like a curious teenager now!",
    "cang01_NPC005_048": "Sounds like you're just trying to find an excuse to be loud and noisy there... but I guess you do have a point.",
    "cang01_Player_073": "Uhm... Mr. Skia.",
    "cang01_NPC03403_004": "Well, it's just that rumor has it... that there used to be this kind of flower that feeds on people's sincerity, and that as a gift, the flower really helps people see just how much you mean to them, even if you're giving it to someone who doesn't speak your language...",
    "cang01_NPC006_021": "Heh... Let's get to business. Teens often face unpredictable issues. Without knowing the cause, it's hard to proceed.",
    "cang01_NPC006_102": "Uhm? No, my Esper is nowhere as powerful as that.",
    "cang01_NPC006_005": "Hahaha, but thinking back, we didn't really get a chance to know each other better... what a shame!",
    "cang01_NPC006_086": "Haha, there were so many of them. Boy, was that a lot of work...",
    "cang01_NPC006_032": "Oh, here... Maybe I'll sit this one out.",
    "cang01_NPC006_048": "Hey, Skia, looking great there, huh?",
    "cang01_NPC006_120": "Oh?",
    "cang01_NPC006_095": "I mean, I'd rather see what we did as helping a friend.",
    "cang01_NPC006_078": "They might not have grown directly out of him, but they definitely seem connected to something inside him.",
    "cang01_NPC006_066": "Would have been nice if we could ask it a few questions, which I'm sure would have been better than nothing. Think we're on our own to figure out their behavioral patterns now.",
    "cang01_NPC03901_008": "I guess getting a phone call asking for a ransom would have made us feel better than having to sit here and worry.",
    "cang01_NPC006_114": "Trying to communicate through something other than language is... well, rather difficult...",
    "cang01_NPC03801_017": "Well... you have my apologies.",
    "cang01_NPC006_089": "Argh... see, this is what I hate about all the red tape.",
    "cang01_NPC04801_014": "You have my prayers!",
    "cang01_NPC03402_002": "Let's see... We were trying to find out if we could ask the school to give us permission to grow more kinds of anomaly plants...",
    "cang01_Player_105": "Uhm... I can feel the energy of an anomaly that's spreading out from the glass house toward every corner of the manor.",
    "cang01_Player_140": "Well, guess this is a perfect gift for you, then... Mr. Baicang?",
    "cang01_NPC006_127": "But this is a novel anomaly, right? Should we try a little something and see what we can learn about its nature and how it works?",
    "cang01_NPC006_094": "Oh, c'mon. We were only doing our job, and it just so happened to be what you were doing, too.",
    "cang01_NPC03301_001": "Oh... so you're here to learn about Maiyue.",
    "cang01_NPC02701_001": "Oh... we actually heard about it through our community news yesterday.",
    "cang01_NPC006_052": "Oh boy, guess I'll take that as a compliment.",
    "cang01_NPC006_016": "Oh, I'm touched. You see me as a warm-hearted person. With that, I'll definitely help you...",
    "cang01_NPC03304_014": "Uhh?Uhh??",
    "cang01_NPC006_074": "Hey, can you hear me? Can you give yourself a hand there and get yourself out?",
    "cang01_NPC006_001": "Oh man, ever since... the incident in New Helios, we haven't had a chance to talk, right?",
    "cang01_NPC006_108": "Yeah, I... I mean, in the end, humans are the ones who assign meanings to flowers, words, and phrases, so no need to fuss over it.",
    "cang01_NPC005_030": "Yup... my thought exactly.",
    "cang01_NPC006_097": "Yeah... he was caught by the anomaly and was made the <blue>Temporary Gardener.</> The Gardener does the talking for the anomaly... also serving as its Nexus.",
    "cang01_NPC010_002": "Well, yes... as far as I'm concerned, this commission isn't unrelated to anomalies.",
    "cang01_Player_084": "Hmm.",
    "cang01_Player_129": "Right. My clients tried to help me feel better about that, too...",
    "cang01_Player_080": "Yup, and apologies for any inconvenience caused.",
    "cang01_NPC006_012": "Hmm? Don't rush off just yet—",
    "cang01_NPC006_077": "Yes. See, these roots here all feed on his body.",
    "cang01_NPC006_053": "Well, we can't wait for the sun to be gone. You're coming, right?",
    "cang01_Player_034": "Hmm?",
    "cang01_NPC04801_001": "Poking your nose into people's families, huh?",
    "cang01_NPC005_001": "Hmm? Fancy meeting you here.",
    "cang01_NPC006_100": "Uhm? Oh, it's nothing. It worked wonders on the teenage boy, though. And I'm glad that did the trick and brought him back.",
    "cang01_NPC006_062": "Uhm? Guess it's because I talk louder and accidentally set off some reaction.",
    "cang01_NPC006_121": "Uhm? Guess it's because I talk louder and accidentally set off some reaction.",
    "cang01_NPC006_008": "Oh? Already on official work?",
    "cang01_Player_100": "This smell that's answering me, isn't it from Maiyue's consciousness...?",
    "Tcang01_NPC006_015": "Because I don't have any impressive skills, I used to think about relying on niche skills to make a living.",
    "cang01_Player_118": "But you ended up getting trapped here, which is why you were never able to give them the flower.",
    "cang01_NPC010_003": "The couple have tried all sorts of ways they could think of to find their kid.",
    "cang01_NPC03501_003": "In the middle of the Math Building, you'll see a gazebo when you get there.",
    "cang01_NPC006_079": "When he talks, I can see slight vibrations traveling to all these plants here at the same frequency.",
    "cang01_NPC010_008": "Let's be professional and do what we can do.",
    "cang01_Player_115": "We learned quite a few things trying to figure out where you went...",
    "cang01_NPC006_087": "I'm not good. I can't breathe! Skia, you gotta bring a gurney here and carry me back!",
    "Tcang01_NPC006_017": "Guess I know why Maiyue never really spoke now.",
    "cang01_NPC04801_008": "The family communicates in sign language, and I guess the boy's parents learned it for the boy.",
    "cang01_Player_041": "The boy often visited this florist. Maybe there are clues we missed. Then, we'll go to the school.",
    "cang01_NPC006_019": "A missing teenager... unexpected.",
    "cang01_Player_124": "Yup.",
    "Tcang01_NPC006_027": "Hey, don't be so upset. I was just trying to lighten up the mood...",
    "Tcang01_Player_011": "You hear that?",
    "cang01_NPC006_103": "Well, fine, my ability is plant talk, and I had a meaningful and soul-touching conversation with the plants in the glasshouse through a frequency neither of you could pick up. I asked them to wither for a second to clear out a path for us to save the kid.",
    "cang01_Player_066": "I see. Thank you.",
    "cang01_NPC006_031": "Let's go in then.",
    "cang01_Player_106": "These plants that underwent rapid growth are like the arms and legs—or sensory organs, if you will—of the manor... They can hear and understand what we're saying...",
    "cang01_NPC03801_023": "If—and I mean \"if\"—our boy went missing because of what's been on his mind...",
    "cang01_NPC006_023": "If he's in a unique situation and you can't communicate, it'll be troublesome...",
    "cang01_NPC010_005": "Please look into it and, if this commission actually has nothing to do with an anomaly, please do report to me immediately regardless, too.",
    "cang01_NPC005_047": "If you don't want trouble, be careful not to disturb them.",
    "cang01_NPC006_084": "Divergent thinking? I like that. Let me go and look for some flowers with you.",
    "cang01_NPC010_009": "The client lives on <blue>White Parrot Street.</> I will ask them to wait at home. Appraiser, please head out at once.",
    "Tcang01_NPC006_011": "The school's club activities include quite a variety of interests, huh.",
    "cang01_NPC005_008": "If needed, I'll go alone and deal with him later.",
    "cang01_NPC03901_005": "Where did he go, though... We didn't see anything out of the ordinary about him at all...",
    "cang01_NPC006_093": "You're welcome!",
    "cang01_NPC03801_011": "kidnapping shouldn't be one of our worries...",
    "cang01_NPC005_029": "The family's descendent... who is also the owner of this manor, does not live in Hethereau. <blue>The BAC General Department</> has been trying to get in touch for the entire day but to no avail.",
    "cang01_NPC005_005": "Yes. We were to handle something together, but he vanished with \"you're reliable, can do it alone\" and \"I'd be a burden\" excuses...",
    "cang01_Player_132": "Oh, what did you say to Maiyue when you spoke to him in sign language?",
    "cang01_NPC03801_016": "Oh, I don't mean to be rude, but... do you know sign language?",
    "cang01_Player_022": "Would you happen to know where he might have gone?",
    "cang01_NPC03601_002": "Yeah, I guess he moved here because of his parents' work.",
    "cang01_NPC04801_010": "Oh, there is this one thing I remember about them. There was this one time I made the boy some extra food because his parents were too busy with work to cook him.",
    "cang01_NPC005_031": "The pollens are suffocating if you let them go inside your nose.",
    "cang01_Player_076": "Like what Captain Baicang said, I'm looking for this teenager who went missing, and it seems like he's involved in this incident.",
    "cang01_Player_113": "He's trying to tell us something with these flowers here. Maybe we can do the same with the flowers in this manor and try to wake him up?",
    "cang01_Player_037": "You do...?",
    "cang01_NPC006_083": "These are rockroses, and the floriography is Sensitive and Rejection...",
    "cang01_NPC03901_001": "I've already called everyone I know... What are we gonna do...",
    "cang01_NPC006_129": "Keep in touch, young ones!",
    "cang01_NPC03302_002": "I don't think anyone would purposely give him a hard time... He was a really nice kid.",
    "cang01_Player_069": "A deserted manor, huh... Thank you.",
    "cang01_NPC04801_012": "And, boy, was I touched... Argh, this really reminds me of those ungrateful brats of mine back home...",
    "cang01_Player_079": "Of course.",
    "cang01_NPC006_025": "And right now, the best help might be... in front of you?",
    "cang01_NPC006_109": "Why?",
    "cang01_Player_046": "Why?",
    "cang01_NPC006_018": "So, what's your commission?",
    "cang01_NPC03302_001": "It just seemed like... you know, he had a very difficult time forming his language and expressing himself...",
    "Tcang01_NPC03304_002": "Thoughts❀❀ ❀❀Budding",
    "cang01_NPC006_080": "Well, to sum it up, if we just destroy these plants, it's going to put Maiyue at risk, too.",
    "cang01_NPC006_069": "Probably not as strongly as you do, but these flowers here are indeed spreading the emotions they're meant to represent...",
    "cang01_NPC006_045": "My thoughts exactly.",
    "cang01_Player_117": "And what you wanted them to know... Was it \"that which has always been there\"?",
    "cang01_NPC006_047": "Remember how I was really surprised when I ran into you today? Well, seems like we're looking at more surprises down the road now.",
    "cang01_NPC03501_002": "Oh, the dude that came last semester...",
    "cang01_NPC005_034": "He's not thinking straight. Listen to what he says and it's clear that he doesn't mean to say any of these.",
    "cang01_NPC006_070": "Anger, malice, and unwillingness to have their inner worlds looked into.",
    "cang01_NPC006_099": "People who truly care about him will always be patient enough to understand what he's trying to say, huh...",
    "cang01_Player_108": "I know there's something wrong with the pollens... but I don't think they hurt as badly as you make it sound.",
    "cang01_NPC03801_020": "We've been looking for him everywhere for the entire day but haven't had any luck... Argh. Any progress there...?",
    "cang01_NPC03901_006": "We kept calling him but he never picked up...",
    "cang01_NPC03801_004": "We've already searched all night and no news from the <blue>Security Office</>. Asking for the Anomaly Hunters to help cover a larger area was our last resort...",
    "cang01_NPC02303_002": "Right, his parents actually came here earlier, too.",
    "cang01_NPC02702_001": "Makes me wonder where the boy went...",
    "cang01_Player_008": "I'll look into it as soon as I can, but I do have a few questions that need to be confirmed before I get there.",
    "cang01_NPC006_029": "I'm on vacation, bored, and helping you earns me a free tea. It's not a bad deal.",
    "cang01_NPC006_035": "I wasn't lying! The task is at night, so this time counts as vacation.",
    "cang01_NPC04801_004": "We make a pretty nice neighborhood, and they told me a bit about what Maiyue had been through.",
    "cang01_NPC03801_007": "My son... really struggles with communication. He has never been comfortable around people he doesn't know, so he usually only goes home and some places around school that he's familiar with.",
    "cang01_NPC02303_005": "Let's see... I remember looking into it this morning. The last time... pink carnations...",
    "cang01_Player_109": "I can feel the Nexus... It's around Maiyue... Wait, no... I think it's inside him.",
    "cang01_Player_013": "I'm going to investigate this place that Maiyue often visits, but you two should rest now since it's already so late. I'll reach out to you once I have updates.",
    "cang01_NPC006_007": "I was just about to have afternoon tea. Join me? Come on, join me!",
    "cang01_NPC006_118": "Let me guess. Is it \"I ran into this super interesting person!\"? Or \"I found this thing I've never seen before!\"...?",
    "cang01_NPC03601_001": "I know him. He's the guy who never said anything, right?",
    "cang01_NPC006_113": "So if you try to be a little more patient here... then you just might figure out what I was going to ask you.",
    "cang01_NPC03801_009": "Which is why we're so worried and thinking if something bad happened to him...",
    "cang01_NPC005_015": "So you're saying that he might have been trapped in there since last night?",
    "cang01_Player_014": "Sign language...?",
    "cang01_NPC006_026": "I know sign language.",
    "cang01_Player_019": "Excuse me, I'm looking for this boy by the name of Maiyue. He went missing.",
    "cang01_NPC006_009": "She put you to work so quickly... That's SO her.",
    "cang01_NPC03901_013": "Sorry... but our son actually suffers from vocal disabilities, which is why you probably need to know sign language to communicate with him.",
    "cang01_Player_042": "Well, I was actually looking for a boy who went missing... and as far as we know, he came around a lot.",
    "cang01_Player_082": "Sorry, but I'm afraid I can't answer those questions until I have more facts to share.",
    "cang01_NPC03801_013": "Please!",
    "cang01_NPC03901_003": "Please, help us!",
    "cang01_NPC03901_010": "We asked his teacher to ask the class about it, but no one has seen him again after school yesterday.",
    "cang01_NPC005_012": "We had JTF onto the situation as per the protocols, except the sun was already up by the time they arrived. The plants in the manor were activated and startled from exposure to the sun, distorting and twisting the anomaly into something we had never seen before.",
    "cang01_NPC03801_003": "This is the Anomaly Hunter we hired. Now... bring us up to speed here!",
    "cang01_Player_050": "Searching for the captain...? Uh... Captain Baicang?",
    "cang01_NPC006_090": "Hey, remember you promised to chat over tea with me, yeah?",
    "cang01_NPC006_037": "Relax. Skia is more reliable than he seems... despite being dreadfully boring.",
    "cang01_NPC006_082": "Did he give up trying to communicate? It's not necessarily what he meant to do, of course...",
    "cang01_Player_083": "But rest assured that we'll bring him home safely.",

    "cang01_NPC006_027": "Life's tough, more skills help... Want me to join?",
    "cang01_NPC005_009": "Well, I got stuff to do. See you.",
    "cang01_NPC006_002": "Settling in Hethereau but not visiting the Bureau to see me? As a friend, I've been keeping an eye on you.",
    "cang01_NPC006_072": "But it does!",
    "cang01_NPC03403_001": "We were still here yesterday talking about how we were going to buy some more exotic flowers...",
    "cang01_NPC006_014": "Looking confused but letting valuable info slip by isn't wise.",
    "cang01_NPC005_025": "But I thought we're supposed to be careful with what we say so we don't get attacked again...",
    "cang01_NPC005_045": "But I thought we're supposed to be careful with what we say so we don't get attacked again...",
    "cang01_NPC02303_006": "I think it was eight days ago.",
    "cang01_NPC02701_002": "We do. We adopted this garden here on this street, and we come here every day to clean it.",
    "cang01_NPC03403_003": "Rumor has it that there was this kind of flower... that's unlike anything we've seen before...",
    "cang01_NPC02701_004": "I guess so. He comes around every week from the florist with something.",
    "cang01_NPC04801_009": "Yup. They share a very special bond, the three of them!",
    "cang01_NPC006_101": "Yup, of course.",
    "cang01_Player_002": "Because Eibon only accepts anomaly-related commissions?",
    "cang01_NPC010_006": "It's what we do. Even if it's confirmed that the missing of the kid has nothing to do with an anomaly, it's still... a great relief for the parents.",
    "cang01_NPC02303_004": "Yes, ever since school started after the break. He'd always buy a bunch of flowers from us, but other than that he'd have dinner ingredients and snacks... and some books he bought.",
    "cang01_Player_133": "Is that so?",
    "cang01_Player_138": "He made this in bed in the hospital and asked his parents to give it to us...",
    "cang01_Player_020": "We don't know just yet if he simply went missing or if he got involved in something... Do you know him?",
    "cang01_Player_070": "We gotta head over ASAP...",
    "cang01_NPC04901_003": "I mean, I wouldn't remember anyone like that since we get people reading books quietly here all the time.",
    "cang01_NPC005_026": "We did some research about this manor before coming here.",
    "cang01_Player_089": "Can it be understood? But it's hardly a conversation...",
    "cang01_NPC03901_011": "The cameras at the school gate showed that he left school alone soon after his last class was over. Nobody knew where he went after leaving school...",
    "cang01_NPC005_028": "Intel reveals that this house belonged to the <blue>Serenity</> family hundreds of years ago.",
    "cang01_NPC006_088": "Hey, that's no way to talk to your captain when he almost died from a mission!",
    "cang01_NPC03402_006": "Umm... No for the most part...? We usually just talk about the club.",
    "cang01_NPC006_003": "Huh? Not close?! Ouch?",
    "cang01_Player_043": "Every week, huh... So I guess coming here was like a routine thing for him to do?",
    "cang01_NPC03901_014": "No, that's fine... We're already ever-so grateful that you're willing to help us!",
    "cang01_Player_015": "That's fine. I don't know sign language, but I'll try my best to communicate.",
    "cang01_NPC006_046": "That's fine. I sort of know where he is now.",
    "cang01_NPC04801_003": "Ah... that's a pity. I have no idea, and I don't know how I can help.",
    "cang01_NPC005_017": "That's no compliment by the way.",
    "cang01_Player_004": "No problem.",
    "cang01_Player_087": "Woah, I swear to God that was only one single line of malice...",
    "cang01_NPC00402_001": "It's club activity time, no outsiders allowed.",
    "cang01_NPC006_124": "This place is so green it looks anything but deserted.",
    "cang01_Player_035": "True, first confirm his location...",
    "cang01_Player_144": "I decided to drop it since I didn't think you'd answer me anyway.",
    "cang01_Player_122": "Looks like you're doing just fine.",
    "cang01_NPC005_022": "Seems like they can just corrode the plants around them...",
    "cang01_NPC006_126": "They have a bunch of plants that seem hard to keep alive and they seem like weeds now.",
    "cang01_NPC03801_021": "You did? Where is he? What happened to him? Is he doing okay? What exactly is...",
    "cang01_NPC006_085": "I'm done with all these flowers and weeds here... Thank God we're leaving.",
    "cang01_NPC03801_018": "Please do...! Thank you!",
    "cang01_NPC03801_015": "Thank you! But I think... we're just going to look for him some more... Can't really just go to bed feeling all worried...",
    "cang01_Player_055": "Guess you do have a point... Well, thank you anyway.",
    "cang01_Player_094": "It just popped out like that?",
    "cang01_NPC005_035": "Wait, you don't want what?",
    "cang01_NPC04801_011": "And guess what? He gave me this flower card he'd made himself—just to thank me!",
    "cang01_Player_048": "Mr. Skia? Good afternoon.",
    "cang01_NPC006_061": "Skia, can you stand there and pretend to be a ladder for a second?",
    "cang01_NPC006_122": "Skia, can you take the lead and turn on the lights?",
    "Tcang01_NPC006_026": "Skia, is the dope fursuit the only thing you got from your ability? I mean, did it sort of... you know, upgrade your nose?",
    "cang01_NPC03301_004": "Well, we've been told to be a little more patient with him.",
    "cang01_NPC02702_003": "And we didn't see anything out of the ordinary about him...",
    "cang01_NPC03401_002": "And he seemed to struggle with grammar even over text...",
    "cang01_NPC005_003": "Just my duty.",
    "cang01_NPC010_004": "And they were on the brink of a meltdown when they reached out to us... so we couldn't just turn them away.",
    "cang01_Player_038": "Having your help would be great... but...",
    "cang01_NPC005_016": "Well, compared to someone who skipped work and dug this all out, I wouldn't say I'm catching on fast at all.",
    "cang01_Player_134": "And the thing that made all the plants wither in an instant... was that your ability?",
    "cang01_NPC005_046": "But at least they're partially similar to your normal plants. They become less active at night, for instance...",
    "cang01_NPC006_057": "Guess it won't take Alphard longer to go through your additional submission than it'd take him to approve my pay cut.",
    "cang01_NPC006_071": "The pollens give you a sting if they land on your skin... Oh, guess you don't feel it with the leather suit?",
    "cang01_NPC005_007": "I'd like to catch him, but I must prepare...",
    "cang01_NPC005_027": "I've always known that this garden exists here, but I don't remember having been told who owns this place.",
    "cang01_NPC006_119": "Making up for this missed step here should be a breeze for you.",
    "cang01_Player_059": "Maybe we should contact the clients and have them speak to the teacher...",
    "cang01_NPC005_018": "We need to start working on this case as soon as we can.",
    "cang01_NPC006_039": "If it was an ETD mission, we'd have free access, unfortunately...",
    "cang01_NPC006_067": "Should we try to share what we already have figured out?",
    "cang01_NPC03401_001": "Well, I guess he's just an awfully quiet guy.",
    "cang01_NPC03801_024": "If you do see him, please bring our words to him...",
    "Tcang01_NPC006_028": "But, well, I'm not hearing anything weird either.",
    "Tcang01_Player_014": "It sounds more like... someone mumbling to themselves.",
    "cang01_NPC006_010": "Why are there so many bothersome approval procedures... Bureau rules are so rigid!",
    "cang01_NPC005_006": "And now, he's nowhere to be found.",
    "cang01_NPC006_096": "Speaking of which, though, how did your clients do after that?",
    "cang01_Player_093": "Huh?",
    "cang01_Player_061": "Where's the Garden Club?",
    "cang01_Player_081": "We did make some headway.",
    "cang01_NPC006_116": "Thanks, oh do remember to keep us updated if you've ever come across rumors like that again. See, you really need things like that to spice up your life when you're a grown-up.",
    "cang01_Player_062": "Thank you.",
    "cang01_Player_030": "Thanks for the... offer. Maybe next time when I'm free, I'll be glad to know more about your story.",
    "cang01_Player_028": "Thanks for the invite. I have a commission to handle though...",
    "cang01_NPC03304_019": "You have a great voice. Thank you.",
    "cang01_Player_126": "Thank you.",
    "cang01_NPC03801_006": "Thanks! Fire away!",
    "cang01_Player_123": "Thank you so much.",
    "cang01_NPC03403_002": "Oh and we talked about this rumor, too...",
    "cang01_NPC006_076": "I thought we were here to save the kid, but it seems like we're not needed here.",
    "cang01_Player_120": "How are you feeling?",
    "cang01_Player_146": "Nothing really stands out there...",
    "cang01_NPC03801_012": "Anything else you'd like to learn about? Would it help if you went through our place?",
    "cang01_NPC005_039": "We still need to wrap things up here. Are you... still good?",
    "cang01_NPC04801_013": "And there was this one time when we were trying to organize an event for people to adopt green space... Oops, you came to look for clues to find the boy, right? Guess I should let you go already!",
    "cang01_NPC03601_004": "And I think he's part of the Garden Club... and that's pretty much all I know about him since we never talked.",
    "cang01_NPC03801_010": "Uhm... see, we're just your regular family, as you can see.",
    "cang01_NPC02701_003": "He came up with all these nameplates for the plants with their information on them. He doesn't really talk, but he never slacks.",
    "cang01_NPC006_065": "Don't think anyone wants it? It's probably just left to rot here because people think this place is too far for redevelopment.",
    "cang01_Player_137": "Here.",
    "cang01_NPC04801_007": "Speaking of which, I don't think I've ever seen him trying to strike up a conversation at all...",
    "cang01_NPC006_073": "You never know how what we're gonna run into...",
    "cang01_NPC005_023": "There's no place for us to stand here. It's kind of hard to get up there...",
    "cang01_Player_111": "These flowers came popping up just now when he was talking...",
    "Tcang01_NPC006_020": "Well... life is gonna be hard for the kid...",
    "Tcang01_NPC006_029": "Guess this is your Anomaly Perception at work?",
    "cang01_NPC006_030": "That's the spirit! Where to start?",
    "cang01_NPC006_092": "I love this blend.",
    "cang01_Player_023": "I see. Thank you for sharing that.",
    "cang01_Player_040": "If that's the case... Thanks.",
    "cang01_NPC006_107": "I think this flower is more suitable when you're trying to thank your parents... and teachers.",
    "cang01_Player_074": "What... happened here exactly?",
    "cang01_NPC005_043": "It's a little dark here. Watch your steps.",
    "cang01_NPC006_050": "All these plants here are over-activated, and it probably happened when some kid came in not knowing better... and a new anomaly came into existence.",
    "cang01_NPC03901_012": "You're asking for the impossible...",
    "cang01_NPC006_024": "When in doubt, don't be shy, talk to your partners, it's ok.",
    "cang01_NPC006_022": "The missing boy has communication barriers, right?",
    "cang01_NPC02702_002": "The boy always puts his heart into it.",
    "cang01_NPC02303_003": "The boy came here every week but never said a thing. He'd just point at the flowers he wanted, which is why we all remember him.",
    "cang01_NPC005_038": "The kid said he had a lot of plants growing out of him with their roots deep inside him... which is why we found him in such bad shape. Thank God it wasn't life-threatening, though.",
    "cang01_NPC04801_005": "I don't think the boy is unable to speak at all. He's been suffering from a language impairment since he was a kid, which is why he stumbles and stutters when he talks.",
    "cang01_Player_121": "Yup, thank God is right...",
    "cang01_NPC005_037": "I'll stay here, then, in case things get worse.",
    "cang01_NPC006_117": "I'm seeing two kids over there... Let's give them a try.",
    "cang01_NPC006_060": "Don't you think those few that are coming down there look a little dangerous?",
    "cang01_NPC006_013": "Since you ran into me, let me give you some advice as a senior.",
    "cang01_NPC005_014": "Is there anyone trapped in there?",
    "cang01_NPC010_001": "We have a missing person commission for you to work on. Here, have a look at the details.",
    "Tcang01_NPC006_018": "He stopped talking for way too long, and his vocal capabilities suffered as a result.",
    "cang01_NPC03301_006": "But other than that, we didn't notice anything else about him.",
    "cang01_NPC006_125": "The air smells a little nauseating... but as far as the plants go, I'd say whoever picked them does have a good taste.",
    "cang01_NPC02303_001": "The prettiest flowers raised in the loveliest conditions! Need a blossom to speak for your unspoken emotions?",

    "MU01_01_NPC011_053": "Nice, let's be strategically late a little bit like what the main characters in the movies do!",
    "MU01_03_NPC009_076": "No warm-up? Boring.",
    "MU01_03_Player_095": "Something to do with the relationship between Sterry and the target anomaly?",
    "MU01_03_NPC009_102": "I'm not getting into that ugly thing. You can go.",
    "MU01_03_NPC01101_001": "Can you see it clearly?",
    "MU01_01_NPC012_036": "The Esper Abilities of these two are connected to some unknown power, along with Dandelion's power to control space... This is probably what created <blue>Pawn Moonlight</>.",
    "MU01_01_Player_001": "Good morning, you two. Is there something to be picked up?",
    "MU01_03_NPC015_008": "In two days, The Kapé Hotel will host an auction by invitation only, featuring a batch of anomalies with unknown origins.",
    "MU01_02_NPC08901_007": "So, for the safety and enjoyment of our customers, we recommend using Imaginadough for decorations and commemorations, and putting it somewhere safe for display!",
    "MU01_01_NPC02601_014": "So I spent the whole night out there, both trying to avoid him and to see if I'd stumble across inspirations.",
    "MU01_01_Player_126": "Why did Landric find Eibon?",
    "MU01_03_NPC009_033": "Why do you ask?",
    "MU01_03_Player_045": "Why choose Sterry Express?",
    "MU01_03_NPC014_052": "Why not? You did your homework!",
    "MU01_03_NPC018_039": "Why?! You already know Ebisu's security principles!",
    "MP00_00_NPC010_034": "The photos we saw before were all somewhat overexposed and blurry.",
    "Main_Prologue_Alphard_00012": "We'll leave it to you. I hope that {Gender}|gender(he,she) won't cause us trouble.",
    "MU01_03_NPC009_040": "I'm tired, it's time to head back. See you.",
    "MU01_01_NPC011_041": "Boy, we sure are getting more customers these days than we did over the past half a month.",
    "MU01_03_NPC014_035": "How'd you solve that?! So unfair!",
    "MU01_03_Player_022": "Are you trying to poach me, Miss Jiuyuan?",
    "MU01_03_Player_037": "Do you have a plan, Miss Jiuyuan?",
    "MU01_01_Player_033": "You know how to contact the manga's artist?",
    "MU01_01_NPC012_009": "Miss Jiuyuan, we're here today to, to buy some intel.",
    "MU01_03_NPC01401_027": "Miss Jiuyuan, even so, we can discuss today's matter further.",
    "MU01_01_Player_028": "Miss Jiuyuan, perhaps, you have other conditions?",
    "MU01_03_NPC017_080": "That's the most likely guess for now. Let's check the collection room.",
    "MU01_03_NPC009_116": "But no need to spill the beans to the home team, considering their knack for chaos. I'd rather not have Eibon laid bare to Sterry.",
    "MU01_01_NPC008_057": "This is stupid!",
    "MU01_02_Player_056": "I see... so this kind of ability also exists...",
    "MU01_03_NPC009_014": "It's not even that far. We don't need that ugly thing.",
    "MP00_00_NPC010_023": "If we are unable to resolve the issue within the agreed timeframe, a full refund will be provided.",
    "MU01_02_Player_023": "I see. Thank you for such a detailed explanation.",
    "Main_Prologue_Alphard_00015": "No time to lose. Let's set off as soon as possible.",
    "MU01_01_NPC010_035": "Please go to Pawn Moonlight to investigate the truth of the matter in detail.",
    "MU01_03_NPC017_063": "After they split, the wine was sold to the public under her management.",
    "MU01_03_NPC017_103": "Could we compensate you with today's auction pieces?",
    "MU01_01_NPC011_058": "Twenty years is a long time!",
    "Main_Prologue_Zero_00006": "Leave it to me.",
    "MU01_03_NPC015_022": "He's here.",
    "MU01_01_NPC012_013": "In there.",
    "MU01_01_NPC012_011": "Favors are the hardest to repay...",
    "MP00_00_NPC01001_024": "We're a bit short-handed, but the quality of the shoot won't drop because of it. With just two people handling business, it feels like the early days of Film Orbit Studio.",
    "MU01_01_NPC02301_007": "A popular new serialized anime, with interesting ideas and an intricate story. It is suitable for watching on a sunny afternoon sofa. Highly recommended if you are a fantasy series fan!",
    "MU01_03_Player_027": "It feels like... nothing escapes your vigilant eyes...",
    "MU01_01_NPC008_040": "What price?",
    "MU01_01_NPC02601_004": "Oh, what? Totally thought you guys were here to squeeze my manuscripts out of me! Why didn't you just say that? I was scared soulless!",
    "MU01_01_NPC008_067": "What does that mean?",
    "MU01_01_NPC019_017": "When did this happen? You were so straightforward when you were a kid...",
    "MU01_01_NPC008_066": "What the heck is this? I don't want it!",
    "MU01_01_NPC02601_003": "Your what? Ah, trying to trick me into giving you my manuscripts now, huh? Nice try!",
    "MU01_01_NPC011_074": "Over where?",
    "MP00_00_NPC010_012": "From now on, this will be your room. I hope you find it comfortable—Taygedo also put in a lot of effort cleaning it.",
    "MU01_03_NPC018_016": "There's a good crowd here today for our target.",
    "MU01_02_NPC010_044": "I'm afraid watching a movie isn't possible today... We'll have to ask for your understanding in this matter.",
    "MU01_03_NPC014_018": "Most anomalies being auctioned today are Level IV, a notch above the usual fare.",
    "MU01_01_NPC015_009": "Since I'm the only one here today, can you REALLY afford my rate?",
    "MU01_03_NPC017_100": "Today's job threw us some curveballs, but we're thankful for the support from Miss Hotori and you.",
    "MU01_03_NPC017_071": "We might have been too conspicuous at tonight's auction...",
    "MU01_01_NPC00301_023": "Tonight, it's tonight! Solve it tonight and you will get your money!",
    "MU01_01_NPC010_007": "Allow me to introduce you to Bianca. Bianca is a new client who just came in with a commission.",
    "MU01_03_NPC017_028": "Let me introduce our couriers—Haniel and Illica.",
    "MU01_01_NPC02601_030": "I started working on the next chapter of \"Tales of Nil\" on my way home from the pawnshop. That dog, and all the anomalies I had just seen.",
    "MU01_03_NPC015_037": "From the intel we've gathered, there's no shortage of interest in the auction item.",
    "MU01_03_NPC017_090": "From what I know, any rule triggered prioritizes the safety of guests.",
    "MU01_01_Player_078": "Based on these pawn tickets... they're all anomalies that have fulfilled their contracts.",
    "MU01_01_NPC011_075": "Do you think they're in danger?",
    "MU01_01_NPC011_061": "These two aren't the villains either. The real villain is the evil chef!",
    "MU01_02_NPC010_080": "It seems they've opted for a rather... clever approach that's budget-friendly but should still be reasonably effective...",
    "MU01_03_NPC015_058": "All their minds, boggled with ways to milk profit from anomalies. These thieves gave them a nice lesson on anomaly abilities.",
    "MP00_00_NPC010_018": "I think they're trying to get on your good side but aren't sure how to go about it...",
    "MU01_01_NPC00702_007": "His assistant realized that he had gone missing after he hadn't returned for several days.",
    "MU01_01_NPC011_059": "He wanted to pawn something again?",
    "MU01_01_Player_057": "He was worried you'd tell the owners of Pawn Moonlight about his plans, so he kidnapped you.",
    "MU01_01_NPC010_033": "His words are somewhat contradictory. I feel like there's more to it.",
    "MU01_01_NPC00301_003": "And he said...",
    "MU01_01_NPC00301_004": "He said he'd come up with the best recipe for me for the new season and help me win more stars in this year's La Palourde Blanche! And he even gave me this new knife for me to come up with new dishes.",
    "MU01_01_Player_005": "He said he'll pass for now.",
    "MP00_00_NPC010_006": "Since we thought you would arrive later, Taygedo and I were organizing the storage room. I apologize for any inconvenience.",
    "MU01_03_NPC015_064": "Given how slick this crew is, Miss Thief will vanish with the loot before we get ourselves out of here.",
    "MU01_03_NPC017_098": "The mission failed, but your expertise kept us safe. Let's meet up with Miss Hotori.",
    "MU01_02_EC_NPC004A_011": "Eibon... Hidden power, immense!",
    "MU01_01_NPC011_008": "Eibon detectives, on the case!",
    "MP00_00_Player_001": "Is Eibon in this neighborhood?",
    "MP00_00_NPC010_007": "Many of the items Eibon sells are anomaly artifacts, not just ordinary antiques. Rest assured, your ability will be put to good use here.",
    "MU01_03_NPC015_020": "If Eibon can't handle it, we might give you a little surprise...",
    "MU01_01_NPC012_007": "Eibon sometimes does business with them, but Hotori told us not to get too close...",
    "MP00_00_NPC001_016": "Eibon's business isn't great, and Hotori often ends up buying fake antiques at high prices, so the shop relies on accepting <blue>Anomaly Commissions</> from the city...",
    "MP00_00_NPC01001_008": "The owner of Eibon came too? Is it serious?",
    "MU01_03_NPC015_003": "Eibon's manager, I hope you've been well.",
    "MP00_00_NPC001_014": "Eibon's revenue... is only enough to cover renting a <blue>Grumble</> storefront on Hankaku Street.",
    "MU01_03_Player_053": "Illica...?",
    "MU01_03_NPC017_035": "Illica, Haniel, and Hathor will go in as security and waitstaff.",
    "MU01_03_NPC018_028": "Illica is in position!",
    "MU01_02_NPC010_075": "I'm sharing these concerns with you, Appraiser, in hopes that we can work together during the upcoming \"Operation Cupid\" and be prepared to adapt to any unexpected situations.",
    "Main_Prologue_Zero_00025": "Is it dangerous?",
    "MU01_01_NPC02601_031": "Talking white snakes, fish flying in the air... and other creatures whose names I can't even recall...",
    "MU01_03_NPC01401_006": "The fabled anomaly <blue>Narcissus Chain</>.",
    "MU01_01_NPC02601_010": "People say this pawnshop only shows up on the night of the 15th of every month... and all your wishes can come true as long as you're willing to pay the price.",
    "MU01_01_NPC00201_004": "A place that makes all your wishes come true for you as long as you're willing to pay the price.",
    "MU01_03_NPC009_031": "Forging an Ebisu invitation? If we're caught, it'll be bad...",
    "MU01_01_NPC020_009": "Looks like it has nothing to do with you.",
    "MU01_01_NPC02601_017": "But I was a wanted person then and didn't really have the time to think it all through, and I pushed the door... and walked in!",
    "MU01_01_NPC015_020": "But I found the expense records of the \"Tales of Nil\" editor. Besides the publisher and home, he frequently visits a residential address...",
    "MU01_01_NPC012_023": "But... there seems to be quite a big gap between what this new client told us and what we heard from the manga artist before...",
    "MU01_02_NPC04306_003": "But for some reason, when I woke up the next day, I found the whole thing had collapsed into a puddle on the floor, back to its original formless state...",
    "MU01_02_NPC034A_040": "But just like Taygedo said, it'll be really hard to forget such a special performance in the future!",
    "MU01_02_NPC010_007": "But this is your last chance... So, for both Taygedo and Miss Tako, I'll do my best to help. At the very least, let's make this meeting as wonderful as you both imagined.",
    "Main_Prologue_Jin_00003": "At least for now, {Gender}|gender(he,she) is on our side, right?",
    "Main_Prologue_Nelly_00010": "Lower-level anomalies are relatively safe, but please still be careful.",
    "MU01_01_NPC011_078": "As <blue>the strongest, supernatural, and intuitive duo</> of Eibon, the two of us teamed up and still made a mistake.",
    "MU01_03_NPC018_005": "Cheating doesn't count! Who broke my <TypingTitle titlename=\"Bicycle\" titlecolor=\"grey_title\" \" contextcolor=\"blue\">\"Speedy Torny\"</> once!",
    "MU01_01_NPC00301_019": "You little...!",
    "MU01_03_NPC018_003": "You... you put sweet sauce and hot sauce together?!",
    "MU01_01_NPC00301_020": "You... do you have any questions?",
    "MU01_01_NPC02201_003": "And you guys are...?",
    "MU01_01_NPC008_024": "You, you name it!",
    "MU01_03_Player_094": "You didn't join us... Did you discover something else?",
    "MU01_01_NPC011_004": "You're done speaking! The Boss said no, and it's a no. Leave.",
    "MU01_03_NPC015_032": "Have you been to a signing event?",
    "MU01_03_NPC011_003": "Are you here today to ask for the protection of The Coluccis family?",
    "MU01_01_NPC02201_011": "Wait, have you guys seen Dandelion?! Could you just tell me where it is now? It's been 331 days since it went missing and I really miss it!",
    "MU01_03_NPC01401_029": "You can leave... If further investigation is needed, please... cooperate...",
    "MU01_03_NPC009_084": "If you have trouble selling, you can consign it to Eibon. We only take a 5% commission!",
    "MU01_03_NPC015_061": "If only you two could be half as quiet as Hathor.",
    "MU01_01_NPC02501_018": "You can investigate freely, just please be mindful of the arrangement. I don't want his work disrupted.",
    "MU01_01_NPC009_043": "You came back just in time, saved me the work of repeating it.",
    "MU01_03_NPC009_029": "One of you can stay behind.",
    "MU01_01_NPC015_007": "Didn't your boss tell you, in business, impatience is the enemy?",
    "MU01_02_NPC02303_003": "Haven't you heard? It's pretty popular lately. It's a new anomaly toy from DSD.",
    "MU01_01_NPC02501_021": "Is your companion okay?",
    "MU01_01_NPC011_057": "Were your wishes... granted?",
    "MU01_01_NPC00301_018": "Just you wait. I'll sue you! I'll sue you all!",
    "MU01_02_NPC009_012": "See for yourselves, why don't ya?",
    "MU01_01_NPC00301_017": "If this freaks you out, I can totally take this somewhere else!",
    "MU01_01_NPC015_021": "Could it be the author's address?",
    "MU01_02_NPC009_007": "Now, who do we have to thank for all this, hmm?",
    "MU01_01_NPC02601_025": "Hey, there is a lot more to manga drawing than meets the eye here!",
    "Main_Prologue_Zero_00022": "You don't seem surprised.",
    "MU01_01_NPC008_041": "That's one hell of a request to make.",
    "MU01_03_NPC014_049": "Don't make it angry!",
    "MU01_03_NPC009_115": "Just keep in mind, if I'm not around and trouble brews, Sterry's folks are safe to work with.",
    "MU01_03_NPC015_071": "You heard what she said. Can we go now?",
    "MU01_01_NPC008_043": "So you heard it all, huh? Write down your contact info. I'll give your thing back to you when this guy pukes it out.",

    "MU01_01_NPC011_039": "You're shaking it too hard! Chill. Kiroumaru is probably going to puke again in a bit.",
    "MU01_01_NPC011_020": "How did you know—",
    "MU01_01_NPC02501_003": "So you assumed I'm Landric's PR just from the branding?",
    "MU01_03_NPC018_042": "How do you prove that?",
    "MU01_01_NPC011_048": "You wish! By the way, I was hoping to wake up as strong as Master Daffodill tomorrow!",
    "MU01_03_NPC018_038": "You're an amateur!",
    "MU01_01_NPC011_032": "Well, about that... I think it's found itself a job already!",
    "MU01_03_NPC018_024": "You must be satisfied, but Jenson really took a big hit.",
    "Main_Prologue_Nelly_00007": "Do you have any questions?",
    "MU01_01_NPC02601_037": "You came at the right time! Your visit has inspired me. Mind if I borrow today's events as material?",
    "MU01_01_Player_041": "Speaking of which, your \"Tales of Nil\" only just started gaining traction, right? Wait...",

    "MU01_03_NPC011_008": "So the Grinster's here to tell on us to the boss?",
    "MU01_01_NPC009_027": "So where is this Pawn Moonlight that you were talking about? I was just thinking we should pay them a visit.",
    "MU01_01_NPC02601_016": "And I was like, where in the world did this door come from in the middle of the night? Really scared the hell out of me!",
    "MU01_01_NPC020_013": "Come here.",
    "MU01_03_NPC017_097": "You're making Jiuyuan and I feel embarrassed.",
    "MU01_03_NPC009_100": "You're not trying to weasel out of paying, are you?",
    "MU01_01_NPC00301_016": "What do you mean?! Of course, I do!",
    "MU01_01_NPC009_001": "The opinion of the person before you is the same as the owner's—",

    "MU01_03_NPC009_049": "It's pretty standard for auctions to be crowded with agents representing buyers and sellers.",

    "MU01_02_NPC012_016": "The original reason for not considering this scenario was insufficient manpower... After all, Mr. Adler and the Appraiser are already needed to play Taygedo's subordinates, making it difficult for them to simultaneously create the crisis.",
    "MP00_00_NPC001_026": "So, you're an Appraiser! No wonder you have an anomaly radar!",
    "MU01_02_NPC010_003": "I see. In his eagerness to impress, Taygedo unconsciously told a better story than reality is, about Eibon and himself.",

    "MU01_03_Player_029": "The original invitation has a <blue>contract</> with the invitee. A replica of this level indeed can't pass inspection.",

    "MU01_03_NPC018_035": "Off it goes again. Hey, at least say thank you!",
    "MU01_01_NPC02601_022": "The twins said the cost depends on the weight of the wish. I thought about wishing to become the best manga artist in the world just for fun! But they said it would cost me twenty years of my sight.",
    "MU01_03_NPC014_019": "There's been some shuffling on the guest list too. Security's on high alert, so let's tread carefully.",
    "MP00_00_NPC009_013": "Reputation, reputation!",
    "MU01_02_NPC010_074": "On the other hand, since Taygedo believes this is the best way to express his feelings fully, we should support his all-out effort as his friends. After all, our initial goal was to help him avoid any regrets.",
    "MU01_02_NPC012_015": "Furthermore, I've compiled statistics on the frequency of the \"Damsel in Distress\" trope in various shoujo manga series. The data confirms a consistent rise in reader popularity when this scenario is employed.",
    "MU01_02_NPC010_066": "Moreover, the attention and admiration from onlookers will create a sort of... invisible pressure.",
    "MU01_03_NPC009_112": "Got a few other things to verify.",
    "MU01_03_NPC015_021": "Just a bit of chit-chat.",

    "MU01_03_Player_018": "Just a hunch.",
    "MU01_01_Player_082": "But his wish hasn't come true.",
    "MP00_00_NPC013_001": "It's just a low-level anomaly. Does it really warrant a personal visit from Hotori?",
    "MU01_03_Player_048": "Just a coincidence or a vague statement.",
    "MU01_02_NPC010_052": "However, you've always taught us that true grace lies in upholding our principles even in the face of injustice. I humbly ask that you reconsider your actions, Sir.",
    "MU01_01_NPC012_034": "It's just speculation... but from all the clues, it seems that one of the two has an exchange ability related to the <blue>pawn contract</>.",
    "MU01_03_Player_051": "I assume we only need to confirm its authenticity and then bid to win it. Do we really need to arrange for extra help?",
    "MU01_03_NPC015_052": "Miss Thief and I think alike. If I were after a super discount on the target anomaly, I'd play it the same way.",
    "MU01_01_NPC009_026": "I was just checking... Well, consider this a deal.",
    "MU01_02_NPC010_069": "However, I personally have some reservations about this plan...",
    "MU01_01_Player_101": "Just pawn tickets. What's this...?",
    "MU01_03_NPC015_018": "As long as information flows, Sterry Express is likely involved.",
    "MU01_02_NPC02303_004": "If you're handy, you can mold this anomaly dough into anything you want... at least to look like anything you want. It's pretty cheap too. I use it to decorate the story with something fancy. When I get bored of one, I can just remold it into something else.",
    "MU01_02_NPC034A_027": "As long as the toys belong to me and are loved, I can share my will with them!",
    "MU01_01_NPC00301_012": "I just want to bust this fraud of a pawnshop and get my sense of taste back!",
    "MU01_03_NPC017_012": "I only need one day. Friends helping one another is a beautiful thing, don't you think?",
    "MU01_03_NPC017_088": "Don't underestimate this one. The <blue>rules</> it enforces can't be broken by any external force within its domain.",
    "MU01_03_NPC009_045": "Don't go around saying I'm tough on the rookies, okay?",
    "MU01_02_NPC010_023": "Excuse me, but we are interested in this diamond. Can we talk about this for a bit?",
    "MU01_02_NPC034A_016": "Really? Thank you! Thank you so much!",

    "MU01_01_NPC008_010": "Hmph, the bad dog and stinky bird must be in cahoots!",
    "MU01_03_NPC009_072": "Can you believe it? The famous Kapé won't even let you take leftovers. So stingy!",
    "MU01_03_NPC009_015": "Humph, we'll get there ourselves.",
    "MU01_01_NPC008_039": "That's just a bunch of nonsense!",
    "MU01_02_NPC011_012": "Heh, it's all thanks to the Coluccis' unbeatable adaptability and can-do spirit!",
    "MU01_01_NPC008_053": "Hmph, fine. We'll see when we go there tonight. And don't fool around and get in my way, yeah?",
    "Main_Prologue_Mint_00037": "Hmm...",
    "MU01_03_NPC014_038": "Whoo... How to use Picky—mental note taken, hehe.",

    "MU01_02_NPC010_049": "Well, Sir tried to win Miss Tako a plush toy, but it's not going very smoothly...",
    "MU01_02_Player_059": "Hmm, what are the odds of this actually working?",
    "MU01_02_Player_005": "Hmm, well isn't that lovely?",

    "MU01_03_NPC009_093": "Ah... So it's called The First Branch...",
    "MU01_03_NPC00401_003": "Ah, an Ebisu invitation. A fine piece.",
    "MU01_03_NPC015_024": "Ah... Even our dim-witted staff wouldn't be fooled by this.",
    "MU01_03_NPC00501_001": "Ah, we're late! Seems like we can't get in anymore.",
    "MU01_01_NPC011_013": "Ah—That won't do! Those intel dealers won't give us information for free!",
    "Main_Prologue_Mint_00041": "Ahhh... My poor ears can't take it anymore...",
    "MU01_01_NPC011_067": "Ah! So, so he—",
    "MU01_02_NPC09001_011": "Ah...",
    "MU01_02_NPC012_011": "Ah... right. To create lasting memories for the other person...",
    "MU01_01_NPC02201_032": "Ah... I am really sorry. I am not blaming you. It's just that the collar is very important to me.",

    "MU01_03_NPC011_010": "Oh that, hahaha. We were... just passing by last time. Yep, just passing by!",
    "MU01_02_NPC02303_005": "Ah, please handle it with care. It's still soft by nature and can easily lose its shape... I spent ages molding this into a tutorial...",
    "MU01_03_NPC014_061": "Uh-oh...",
    "MP00_00_NPC01001_009": "Ah! My studio... it won't close down, will it?",

    "MU01_01_NPC009_038": "Tsk. What should I buy with the commission fee?",
    "MU01_03_NPC009_008": "Tsk, never mind.",
    "MU01_01_NPC02601_024": "Pfft, please. \"Tales of Nil\" is mid at best, it's not beating \"Gen Z\".",
    "MU01_03_NPC011_009": "Hey, don't even think about stealing our newcomer!",
    "MU01_01_NPC011_072": "Hey, how could you guys leave me behind and come in first?",
    "MP00_00_NPC011_022": "Hey! Stop making things scary!",
    "MU01_01_NPC008_001": "Hey! You impolite old—",
    "MU01_01_NPC008_054": "Hey, silly, let's go!",
    "MU01_02_NPC011_009": "Hey! Adler! Over here!",
    "MU01_01_NPC008_069": "Hey! Poker face, say that again—",
    "MU01_03_NPC018_029": "Hey, what's the point of remembering such bad stuff?",
    "MU01_03_NPC011_001": "Hey, you, the show-off over there. There's a huge <TypingTitle titlename=\"Insect\" titlecolor=\"grey_title\" \" contextcolor=\"blue\">Hercules Beetle</> on your back!",
    "MU01_02_NPC009_011": "Here. Wanna take a look?",
    "MU01_03_NPC009_096": "Look who's here, just who you've been looking for.",
    "MU01_03_NPC011_006": "This is the Grinster, the manager of the group that sells intel.",
    "MP00_00_NPC01001_023": "Hey, wasn't the store previously asked to temporarily suspend business by the BAC? So we just gave everyone a break. Now it's just me and Rocky here.",
    "MU01_01_NPC009_014": "Hmm... Looks like Eibon should take this commission.",
    "MU01_01_NPC015_005": "Hmm... Looks interesting.",
    "MU01_01_NPC015_012": "Hmm... Let me think... New customer discount, one piece of intel, in exchange for getting to know the appraiser. How about it?",
    "MP00_00_NPC009_025": "Hmm... These models don't look too different. Could use them as set pieces, get double the work done—",
    "MP00_00_NPC009_006": "Hmm... This can be a big or small issue...",
    "MP00_00_NPC011_013": "Hmm... This photo is very clear.",
    "MU01_03_NPC009_067": "Hmm—that over there looks pretty good.",
    "MU01_02_NPC010_083": "Hmm... Everything is in place now.",
    "Main_Prologue_Zero_00008": "Hmm... just intuition. The atmosphere here is no different from where we came from.",

    "MP00_00_NPC001_025": "Yep! Our new member is here.",
    "Main_Prologue_Alphard_00009": "Alright, then this containment breach will count towards your performance.",
    "Main_Prologue_Zero_00003": "Yes, you seemed troubled earlier.",
    "MP00_00_NPC010_040": "Yes, Taygedo can deconstruct objects he touches and then reconstruct them.",
    "Main_Prologue_Zero_00013": "Yeah, it told me.",
    "MU01_02_Player_031": "Yeah, it's not like he was trying to exclude Nanally and Sakiri... Taygedo's just feeling a bit shy.",
    "MP00_00_NPC010_037": "Yes, that makes sense.",
    "MU01_02_Player_008": "Yeah, I could help too.",
    "MU01_03_Player_054": "Yeah, I've noticed that too.",
    "MU01_03_NPC009_039": "Yes, {Gender}|gender(he,she) will come to see you tomorrow.",
    "MP00_00_Player_041": "Yes, it's very impressive.",
    "MU01_03_NPC017_091": "Hmm, we'd better hurry.",
    "MP00_00_Player_022": "Nice to meet you.",
    "MU01_03_NPC016_003": "Hmm, don't worry. I'll look after Miss Hotori. Focus on the commission.",
    "MP00_00_Player_023": "Yes, thank you for accompanying me. See you next time.",
    "MU01_03_Player_041": "Yep, the invitation has been swapped.",
    "MU01_03_Player_040": "Okay. I'll head back first, see you tomorrow.",
    "MU01_03_NPC017_017": "Yes, just some elderly collectors.",
    "MU01_02_NPC010_019": "Yes, it suits you well, sir.",
    "MU01_02_Player_035": "Right. Please remind the others to turn in early as well. See you all tomorrow.",

    "MU01_03_NPC015_025": "Hmm? Compared to seeing a doctor, you need to see this more.",
    "MU01_01_NPC015_008": "Hmm? You must be the new Appraiser at Eibon?",
    "MU01_03_NPC009_069": "What? I'm just getting started...",
    "MU01_03_NPC011_014": "Tch—",
    "MU01_01_NPC011_014": "Shh... quiet! If Boss knows about this she's gonna go funky on my ears again!",
    "MU01_01_NPC02501_027": "Ahh! The air condition here is still as cold as ever.",

    "MP00_00_NPC001_027": "Pfft, haha—Coco understands Oddity language. Taygedo, don't underestimate {Gender}|gender(him,her)!",
    "MU01_01_NPC009_031": "Oh, by the way, we pride ourselves on our business integrity, so it's only natural that we try to make up for it after mistakenly accepting a commission from a villain...",
    "MU01_02_NPC034A_009": "Oh! I wanna go, I wanna go! They have claw machines there! I love collecting plushies!",

    "MU01_03_NPC009_026": "Really? Trust is a valuable investment... So, how do we get in?",

    "MU01_03_NPC009_058": "Really? So that's your angle.",
    "MU01_03_NPC009_060": "Really? So that's your angle.",
    "MU01_03_NPC014_046": "Oh? Containment action begins! Should we disguise as BAC agents? It's more engaging!",
    "MU01_01_NPC015_004": "Oh? Is there a new commission?",
    "MU01_03_NPC015_045": "What? A courteous thief?",
    "MP00_00_NPC011_015": "Oh? Detective Adler, please enlighten us.",

    "MU01_01_NPC00301_013": "I... don't care what I need to do...",
    "MU01_01_NPC02601_006": "Wait, me? Kidnapping a dog?",
    "MU01_01_Player_108": "Or rather, what role did he play in Toshi's disappearance...",
    "MU01_01_NPC02301_010": "Or something light-hearted with constant twists and jokes? \"Operation: Losers\"?",
    "MU01_01_Player_048": "He probably wished for a new dish or something.",
    "MU01_01_NPC009_046": "Maybe you can go and check the nearby mountain, since Eibon's performance...",

    "MP00_00_Player_027": "The room was comfy.",
    "MU01_01_NPC02601_027": "So... I turned them down, although I did take advantage of the opportunity and asked them if I could take a look around in Pawn Moonlight since I was in there already anyway.",
    "MU01_01_NPC009_020": "So what are you going to do exactly? Are you going to destroy this Pawn Moonlight?",
    "MU01_03_NPC009_036": "So, take it easy and brainstorm some ideas with me for another side hustle!",
    "MU01_03_NPC017_033": "That's why we want you, the Appraiser, to verify the authenticity of the items.",
    "MU01_02_NPC04306_005": "So I came here to complain. The staff said they'd pass the feedback to the manufacturer. I just hope it doesn't fall on deaf ears.",
    "MU01_01_NPC011_099": "So it was his own will!",
    "MU01_01_NPC012_030": "So, Mr. Kenneth brought you here?",

    "MU01_01_NPC02601_018": "Yup, you'd think, right? That's what I thought, too. I thought I'd be running into at least one gigantic monster that pointed at me with a balance and went, \"Life... or death...?\"",

Just as I breathed a sigh of relief, I opened the door to find a cardboard box city! The more I walked, the more boxes there were, and they almost formed a wall! I was baffled: where did all these packages come from?\r\nOh, you have no idea how scary it is to walk among a pile of stacked cardboard boxes. It felt as if they could collapse any second! Luckily, after sealing the package, the boxes disappeared, and the items inside were fine. Otherwise, this month's work would have been for nothing! Thinking back, it felt like a maze... If I run into that mess again, I'm switching to food delivery, no joke!",

Watch 13 more times and note any inconsistencies. (PS: 13 is my lucky number)\n3. Conduct a thorough search of the sections with the recorded inconsistencies.\n4. If nothing is found, use frame-by-frame playback to continue the investigation.\n5. Prepare food and water before entering the Video.\nI hold the record for the longest case-solving time in the Video at 19 hours, which remains unbeaten. Hope my tips are helpful to you all!",

    "Anomaly0094_RecordBeforeContent_2": "What comes to mind when you think of school? Endless homework? Sweat pouring on the playground? Or the irrepressible anticipation for summer vacation, even during exams? Eventually, we all leave school and graduate. With the final bell, our student days end before we realize it.\r\nMany of us dream of those irretrievable youthful days. Today, Mr. Noel shares with us his experience of literally stepping back into that \"unreturnable\" school building.\r\n\"Hello, Chatty. I'm your loyal listener. Hearing you narrate those magical stories is one of my most cherished memories of youth.\" Thank you! Thank you for your support! Chatty is honored to have been with you all this time.\r\n\"Like many others, I went to college, graduated, and started working. I followed the path everyone takes, accepting an ordinary, normal life. The shining experiences of my youth seemed to have faded and withered with time. I thought... they were gone for good. But then, it happened. An grand adventure I never thought possible for someone as ordinary as me.\"\r\n\"That day was terrible. It was nearly dawn when I left work. The weather was awful too, and I was soaked without an umbrella. As if I needed more trouble, I encountered that anomaly. The street's vending machines were lifted, arranged, and combined by an invisible hand, forming a solid wall. This should have been a sight I'd dreamed of as a child, but at that moment, it was just an exhausting, frustrating obstacle blocking my way home.\"\r\n\"I just wanted to get home, collapse into bed, and catch a breath from endless work. Why was even this simple wish obstructed? I turned around angrily, trying to find a route home that would shelter me from the rain without too much of a detour. The gears in my brain felt rusted by the rain, creaking before falling apart, scattering useless mental scrap everywhere. Even something this simple was beyond me in my exhausted state.\"\r\n\"Maybe it was a sudden gust making my drenched body shiver, or seeing the cold, imposing lights of the office building where people were still working overtime, or perhaps I simply couldn't think of anything to do in this situation. Whatever it was, call it divine intervention or giving up, my body drove me towards that red door. I knew very well I wasn't looking for shelter from the rain.\"\r\n\"Inside wasn't a volcanic eruption or a raging tsunami, nor a fairytale gingerbread house or cotton candy forest. It was just an abandoned, overgrown building site. Utterly ordinary. Only a vibrant door in the distance, starkly contrasting with the gloomy surroundings, reminded me where I was. From the other side of the door wafted the faint smell of paper, ink, and raw wood. Familiar, pleasant scents that felt safe, like something I'd known long, long ago.\"\r\n\"The library. The library in my old school building.\"\r\n\"When was the last time I'd properly read a book in a library? A box of memories seemed to spring open in my mind. School days, manga magazines in the school library, movie specials, the latest Anomaly Collection Guide... Back then, I was reluctant to go to school, often skipping classes I didn't like to spend whole days mushrooming in the library. Daydreaming based on the adventures in books, fantasizing about experiencing such wonderful anomaly stories myself!\"\r\n\"And indeed, an adventure did happen to me. The school building mysteriously \"disappeared\" on the first day of a new semester. Teachers stared at each other in bewilderment at the large pit where the building used to be, forced to postpone the start of school. The gloomy-faced students instantly brightened up and scattered. No school was amazing! It must have been fate!\"\r\n\"But back then, we were just secretly happy about no classes, no homework, no exams. We never thought about what our student life really meant.\"\r\n\"And now, that school building I thought I'd never see again was right before my eyes.\"\r\n\"Seeing it again, I realized how much I wanted to come back here, how much I wanted to go back to school.\"\r\n\"I still knew the classrooms so well, surely there was still a failed test paper folded into a paper airplane in the desk drawer. I shouted and jumped around like a madman, desperate to throw myself into that small desk and chair. At that moment, I felt like I was back in my youth, full of boundless energy. I started running down the hallway, feeling as light and free as in the past. But soon I had to lean against the wall, gasping for breath, my knees making an all-too-appropriate cracking sound.\"\r\n\"By this time, I had reached the end of the school building. That door, so vividly red as if the paint had just been applied, appeared before me again. It was open, with a steady curtain of rain beyond it.\"\r\n\"If I went out, everything would end. I'd be drenched by the rain of reality again, and if I told others about this experience, they'd just look at me suspiciously, saying it must be delirious ramblings from a cold.\"\r\n\"This place was my sanctuary. It safeguarded the time I had lost, and that's why we met again—I firmly believed this. I wanted to stay. I had to stay.\"\r\n\"I put my hand on the doorknob, firmly pulling it closed.\"\r\n\"The door shut. And then... as if telling me I couldn't stay, that I couldn't go back, this space gradually dissolved and disappeared completely. I was back in the pouring rain, no different from before I entered that door.\"\r\n\"So that's how it is.\"\r\n\"The door, the wall, they all vanished. Everything that could prove I had returned to that school building was gone. It all happened so fast—was it just a dream born from my exhaustion? Or was my body temperature so abnormal that I needed urgent medical care?\"\r\n\"Perhaps none of that matters. I only need to know that those lost times are still treasured somewhere, and that's enough.\"\r\n\"Maybe... the chance to meet again is already the most dazzling miracle. For me, this was the greatest adventure I could have hoped to encounter.\"\r\n\r\n...This is where the letter ends. Thank you for sharing, Mr. Noel. Chatty is honored to have received your letter and witnessed this adventure with you and countless listeners. Lastly, Chatty wants to say: We may encounter many disappointments and sadness, making life feel dull and gray. But no matter what, please do not give up hope and dreams. They may come to you at any moment, waiting for you to witness them. In fact, they might be happening quietly, as long as you are willing to believe.",

Haniel—one of the three elite couriers of Sterry Express, how could a mere anomaly delay the grand plan of delivery dispatch?
